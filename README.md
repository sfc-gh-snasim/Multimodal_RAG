# TechUp 2025 Multimodal RAG Lab 🧑‍🔬

> Authors: Sheena Nasim, Noah Costar

This repository contains the code for the TechUp 2025 Multimodal RAG Lab. It is based on the [multimodal RAG lab](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/cortex-search/blob/851d96bebba764530f856d239d621cd63a717e77/examples/08_multimodal_rag/README.md) produced by our Cortex Search team, with modifications for TechUp 2025.

These modifications are primarily:
1. Using the new [Multi-index Cortex Search Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/cortex-search/multi-index-service) which supports both text and vector indexing.
1. A different set of documents and embeddings.
1. New environment setup.
1. AI SQL enrichment for an unstructured data pipeline.
